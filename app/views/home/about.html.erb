  Does your Fitbit goal feel too easy? No problem - sign up here, and Fitbit <%= link_to 'Noodge', 'http://www.yiddishslangdictionary.com/word/334/noodge' %> will take care of incrementing your Fitbit goal a bit more each day!
</p>

<p>
  By default, Fitbit is set up to increment your steps goal by 10 steps per day. Assuming you're starting off with the default goal of 10,000 steps/day, tomorrow your goal would be raised to 10,010 steps, and two days from now it would be 10,020 steps, &c. (Of course, you can set any increment you want.)
</p>

<p>
  The point is to nudge yourself to keep pushing yourself more and more, and not grow complacent when your goals become easy for you. Gotta keep the target moving if we want to keep improving!
